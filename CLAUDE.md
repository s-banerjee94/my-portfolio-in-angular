# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Commands

- `npm start` — dev server at http://localhost:4200 (development configuration)
- `npm run build` — production build to `dist/my-portfolio-angular`
- `npm test` — Karma/Jasmine tests in watch mode (opens Chrome)
- `ng test --watch=false --browsers=ChromeHeadless` — single test run
- `ng test --include='**/hero.component.spec.ts'` — run a single spec file
- `npm run emulators` — start local Firebase emulators (Auth 9099, Firestore 8081, Storage 9199) with import/export in `./emulator-data`. Always use this instead of bare `firebase emulators:start`: the wrapper (`scripts/emulators.mjs`) runs firebase-tools with its cwd inside `node_modules/.cache`, so debug logs never land in the project root — a locked/delete-pending log there crashes `ng build` with `TS500 EPERM` on Windows. The wrapper also auto-exports the running data to `./emulator-data` every 2 minutes, because `--export-on-exit` alone only fires on a graceful shutdown (rare on Windows) — emulator edits survive closed terminals and force-kills at the cost of the last ≤2 minutes.
- `npm run seed` — fill running emulators with portfolio content + the admin login user (`scripts/seed-emulator.mjs`, idempotent)
- `firebase deploy` — deploy to Firebase Hosting (serves `dist/my-portfolio-angular/browser`)

**Important:** `src/env/environment.ts` has `useEmulators: true`, so the dev server connects to local Firebase emulators (wired up in `app.config.ts`). Start the emulators before `npm start`, or Firestore/Auth/Storage calls will fail. The production build swaps in `src/env/environment.prod.ts` via `fileReplacements` (note: `src/env/`, not the conventional `src/environments/`).

Formatting is Prettier with `prettier-plugin-tailwindcss` (sorts Tailwind classes). There is no lint target.

## Architecture

Angular 21 personal-portfolio SPA backed entirely by Firebase (no custom backend). All components are standalone (no NgModules); app bootstraps via `app.config.ts` providers.

`src/app` is organized by feature area, with TS path aliases (defined in `tsconfig.json`):

- `core/` (`@core/*`) — app-wide singletons: `guards/`, `services/`, `theme/` (PrimeNG preset + `ThemeService`)
- `public/` (`@public/*`) — the public site: `header`, `footer`, `home`, `page-not-found`, and the `*-section` components
- `dashboard/` (`@dashboard/*`) — the admin CMS (editor per section, messages inbox, login)
- `shared/` (`@shared/*`) — reusable presentation pieces: `SectionHeaderComponent`, `RevealDirective`, `pipes/`

The app has two halves, defined in `src/app/app.routes.ts`:

1. **Public site** (`/` → `HomeComponent`): a single scrolling page composed of `*-section` components (`hero-section`, `about-section`, `project-section`, `experience-section`, `contact-section`) plus `header`/`footer`. Navigation uses URL fragments; `HomeComponent` scrolls to the matching element id.
2. **Admin dashboard** (`/admin` → `DashboardComponent`; `/dashboard` redirects there): CMS for the site's content. Child routes: `analytics` (visitor traffic, default landing), `edit-content` (PrimeNG tabs hosting one editor component per section in `src/app/dashboard/*`) and `messages` (contact-form inbox). Protected by `authGuard`; `/login` uses `noAuthGuard` to redirect authenticated users. Both guards wrap Firebase `onAuthStateChanged` in an Observable (`src/app/core/guards/auth.guard.ts`).

### Data layer

Firestore structure (accessed through `@angular/fire`):

- `profile/<sectionName>` docs — singleton content per section (hero, about, contact...), read/written generically via `ProfileService.getSectionData`/`saveSectionData`
- `projects`, `experience`, `resumes` collections — CRUD in `ProfileService` (`src/app/core/services/profile-service.service.ts`), which also handles Firebase Storage uploads/deletes
- `messages` collection — `ContaceMeService` (note the typo in the name/file), which also defines the `Message` interface

Services wrap Firebase promises in RxJS with `from(...)`; components subscribe. Data model interfaces live in the component files that own them (e.g. `Project` in `add-edit-project.component.ts`, `Experience` in `experience.component.ts`, `Resume` in `resume.component.ts`), and services import types from those components — follow this pattern rather than creating a separate models directory.

`CommunicationService` is an EventEmitter bus used to pass the selected project between the dashboard project list and the add/edit form.

Security rules (`firestore.rules`, `storage.rules`): everything is world-readable and auth-required for writes, **except** `messages` and `visits`, which are inverted — anyone can create (public contact form / analytics beacons), only authenticated users can read. Both public-create rules **schema-check the document with `hasOnly(...)`**, so adding a field to `Message` or `Visit` silently breaks public writes until `firestore.rules` lists the new key — deploy rules before hosting when that happens.

`AnalyticsService` (`visits` collection) records visits, clicks, per-section views, and a `session_end` beacon (duration/scroll/exit section) that goes out as a keepalive fetch to the Firestore REST endpoint, since SDK writes die on tab close. Nothing is recorded while the admin is logged in.

### UI stack

- **PrimeNG 21** themed by the custom "Magma" preset (`src/app/core/theme/magma.preset.ts`, built on Aura via `definePreset`); dark mode = `.my-app-dark` class on `<html>`, owned by `ThemeService` (persists to localStorage)
- **Tailwind CSS 4** via PostCSS (`.postcssrc.json`); global styles in `src/styles.css` import `tailwindcss`, `tailwindcss-primeui`, and PrimeIcons — there is no tailwind.config file
- Lucide icons (`lucide-angular`) and Quill (rich text) are also used
- Component style budget is tight (8kB error per component style) — keep styling in Tailwind utility classes, not component CSS

### Other notes

- TypeScript is fully strict (`strict: true` plus `strictTemplates`, `noImplicitReturns`, `noPropertyAccessFromIndexSignature`)
- Static assets live in `public/` (fonts, icons, favicon, robots.txt, sitemap.xml, PWA manifest, FCM service worker); content images and files (hero photo, project screenshots, resume PDFs) are served from Firebase Storage URLs stored in Firestore
